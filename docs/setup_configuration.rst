Django Setup Configuration
==========================

There is optional support for `django-setup-configuration`_ that allows you to automatically configure the
OpenID Connect configuration using that package's ``setup_configuration`` command.

You must install the ``setup-configuration`` dependency group:

.. _django-setup-configuration: https://pypi.org/project/django-setup-configuration/


.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mozilla-django-oidc-db[setup-configuration]


You must then define the required and any optional django settings mentioned below and
put the ``AdminOIDCConfigurationStep`` in your django-setup-configuration steps:

.. code-block:: python

    SETUP_CONFIGURATION_STEPS = [
        ...
        "mozilla_django_oidc_db.setup_configuration.steps.AdminOIDCConfigurationStep",
        ...
    ]

Setup Configuration Settings:
=============================


The setup configuration source must contain the following base keys to use this setup configuration step (using ``yaml`` as an example):

* ``oidc_db_config_enable``: enable setup configuration step boolean

* ``oidc_db_config_admin_auth``: Dictionary that maps OIDC fields to their values.


Example: *setup_config.yml*

.. inject-validated-example:: mozilla_django_oidc_db.setup_configuration.steps.AdminOIDCConfigurationStep

This is file is then used with the setup configuration command setup the OIDC admin:

.. code-block:: Bash

    python manage.py setup_configuration --yaml-file path/to/setup_config.yml


Any field from the ``OpenIDConnectConfig`` can be added to ``oidc_db_config_admin_auth`` (except endpoints, see below)

Required Fields:
""""""""""""""""


* ``identifier``: a unique identifier for this configuration.
* ``oidc_rp_client_id``: OpenID Connect client ID from the OIDC Provider.
* ``oidc_rp_client_secret``: OpenID Connect secret from the OIDC Provider.
* ``endpoint_config``: Dictionary containing endpoint information

    * ``oidc_op_discovery_endpoint``: URL of your OpenID Connect provider discovery endpoint ending with a slash (`.well-known/...` will be added automatically).

            **OR**

    * ``oidc_op_authorization_endpoint``: URL of your OpenID Connect provider authorization endpoint
    * ``oidc_op_token_endpoint``: URL of your OpenID Connect provider token endpoint
    * ``oidc_op_user_endpoint``: URL of your OpenID Connect provider userinfo endpoint


The endpoints must be provided in the ``endpoint_config`` dictionary.
You can add the discovery endpoint to automatically fetch the other endpoints.
Otherwise the endpoints must be specified individually.
Providing both will cause the validation to fail.

Optional Fields:
""""""""""""""""

.. warning::

    Values that are not provided will use the default or empty value and will overwrite any setting changed in the admin.
    Make sure settings that were manually changed in the admin are added to the configuration yaml.

All the following keys are placed in the ``oidc_db_config_admin_auth`` dictionary.

* ``enabled``: whether OIDC is enabled for admin login. Defaults to ``True``.
* ``oidc_op_jwks_endpoint``: URL of your OpenID Connect provider JSON Web Key Set endpoint.
  Required if ``RS256`` is used as signing algorithm. No default value.
* ``claim_mapping``: Mapping from user-model fields to OIDC claims.
  Defaults to ``{"email": ["email"], "first_name": ["given_name"], "last_name": ["family_name"]}``
* ``username_claim``: The name of the OIDC claim that is used as the username. Defaults to ``["sub"]``
* ``groups_claim``: The name of the OIDC claim that holds the values to map to local user groups. Defaults to ``["roles"]``
* ``default_groups``: The default groups to which every user logging in with OIDC will be assigned.  No default values.
* ``superuser_group_names``: If any of these group names are present in the claims upon login, the user will be marked as a superuser.
  If none of these groups are present the user will lose superuser permissions. Defaults to empty list.
* ``make_users_staff``: Users will be flagged as being a staff user automatically.
  This allows users to login to the admin interface. Defaults to ``False``.
* ``oidc_use_nonce``:  Controls whether the OpenID Connect client uses nonce verification. Defaults to ``True``.
* ``oidc_nonce_size``: Sets the length of the random string used for OpenID Connect nonce verification. Defaults to ``32``.
* ``oidc_state_size``: Sets the length of the random string used for OpenID Connect state verification. Defaults to ``32``.
* ``oidc_rp_idp_sign_key``:  Key the Identity Provider uses to sign ID tokens in the case of an RSA sign algorithm.
  Should be the signing key in PEM or DER format. No default.
* ``oidc_rp_scopes_list``: OpenID Connect scopes that are requested during login. Defaults to ``["openid", "email", "profile"]``.
* ``oidc_rp_sign_algo``: Algorithm the Identity Provider uses to sign ID tokens. Defaults to ``"HS256"``.
* ``sync_groups``: If checked, local user groups will be created for group names present in the groups claim,
  if they do not exist yet locally. Defaults to ``True``.
* ``sync_groups_glob_pattern``: The glob pattern that groups must match to be synchronized to the local database. Defaults to ``"*"``.
* ``userinfo_claims_source``: Indicates the source from which the user information claims should be extracted
  (``"userinfo_endpoint"`` or ``"id_token"``). Defaults to ``"userinfo_endpoint"``.
